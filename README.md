# Leviathan Website Homepage with ReactJS 🏋️‍♀️

This is the main homepage for a fake fitness website I created to learn more about ReactJS and CSS.

# Takeaways 🗿

This project taught me about the importance of considering the responsiveness of a website during the design phase. This was something that 
I did not initially have in mind, and found that the slick design of my homepage went completely haywire upon resizing the screen. I have decided
to redo this project from scratch now that I have more experience with CSS.
